files-from-path
===============

Generate a popup contains items with file/folder name

####Plained fixes:####

* Folder with spaces are not work (display only first word). 
* When you trying to press enter to insert path - after path creates tab or 4 spaces. (not checked on another PC, maybe useronly bug)

Build history:

* 10000 - first release
* 10001 - fix for "if folder is empty - tooltip will be generated but without any items."
* 10002 - fix for "in some times path cut not correctly. (math error)"
